# B2B


based on TesV Snip by Figment

automates content porting from Bioware engine to Bethesda engine. Tested with Dragon Age Origins resources to Skyrim engine. Doesn't use official toolsets, e.g. Bethesda Creation Kit is not used. Instead translates serialized gibberish from Bioware engine format into Bethesda serialized gibberish (via XML). Focuses on quests and dialogues. Successfully proved it works in few tests. Do whatever with the repository.
