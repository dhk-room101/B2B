# B2B


automates content porting from Bioware engine to Bethesda engine. Tested with Dragon Age Origins resources to Skyrim engine. Doesn't use official toolsets, e.g. Bethesda Creation Kit is not used. Instead translates serialized gibberish from Bioware engine format into Bethesda serialized gibberish. Focuses on quests and dialogues. Successfully proved it works in few tests. Do whatever with the repository.
